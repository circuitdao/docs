# System Buffer

The system buffer accumulates BYC from liquidation penalties and any BYC surplus obtained in a liquidation auction.

Funds from the system buffer are used to pay for liquidation incentives. For this reason the buffer will maintain a minimum amount of X BYC.

If the amount of BYC in the system buffer exceeds A + B, then an amount B of BYC will be auctioned off in the market for CRT. Any CRT obtained this way will be melted immediately, thereby reducing the CRT supply.
