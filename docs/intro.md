# About Circuit

Circuit is an on-chain collateralized stablecoin protocol built on the **[Chia blockchain](https://www.chia.net)**.

Users can borrow **Bytecash** (**BYC**), the USD stablecoin issued by Circuit, against **XCH**, the native token of Chia.

![1 USD is equivalent to 1 BYC](./../static/img/1USD_equals_1BYC.png)

Bytecash is a [Chia Asset Token](https://chialisp.com/cats/) (CAT). You can get your wallet to recognize BYC coins by [registering](https://docs.chia.net/getting-started/wallet-guide/#add-a-new-cat) their asset ID:
* BYC01: 1763a32f8a9c66f256d8b4631226870ee63dfcfd9668f83c6f75b98f82dc791f (testnet11)

Circuit is being rolled out on testnet11. The [app](https://app.circuitdao.com) allows you to interact with some initial components of the protocol. Check out our [Getting Started](./getting-started) guide, and give it a try!
