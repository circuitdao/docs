# Governance

The CircuitDAO protocol is goverend by a **decentalised autonomous organization** (DAO). The DAO consits of all CRT token holders. Token holders can use their CRT tokens to vote on changes to protocol parameters that define the protocols behaviour. The parameters are defined in the Statutes.

When the DAO votes to change a parameter, the change doesn't immediately become active. Instead, there is an **Implementation Delay** (ID) of several hours or days to ensure that users of the protocol that do not feel comfortable with a change can exit the protocol.

## Parameters

* **Implementation Delay (ID)**
    * recorded in: Statutes
    * initial value: 144 hours
    * updatable: yes
    * votes requied: XYZ CRT
    * considerations: The


<!--
Do we need parameters-specific implementation delays, e.g. shorter delays for less critical variables and the SF, longer delays for critial variables?
MakerDAO uses one Governance Pause Delay for everything
In MakerDAO, votes get approved if simple majority of voters is in favour and a minimum of 10k MKR participated (or voted in favour?). Not quite that simple, it seems. There are different poll types.
