# Run Tail mod

When used as the inner puzzle of a BYC or CRT CAT, **Run Tail mod** enforces the tail to be run. This is done by generating a [magic ```CREATE_COIN``` condition](https://chialisp.com/cats/#tail).

Both BYC and CRT tails enforce the inner puzzle to be Run Tail mod when the tail is run.
