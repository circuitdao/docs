# Protocol launch

Circuit protocol is launched by deploying Statutes, Oracle and Announcer Registry on-chain, and minting the CRT governance token. To function properly, the protocol also needs at least one Treasury coin. All other protocol coins can be launched independently. They are tied to the protocol by mututal coin or puzzle announcements and asserts and/or messages adhering to [CHIP 25](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chips/blob/main/CHIPs/chip-0025.md).

An initial set of Announcer coins should ideally be launched well in advance of protocol launch. This way an informed decision can be made at protocol launch as to which Announcers reliably publish accurate and timely price information and should be approved by governance immediately after protocol launch.

Collateral vaults and savings vaults can be created by users at any time after protocol launch.
